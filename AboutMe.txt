My name is Esther, Ojochogwu Agada.

I am an Admin Officer aspiring to be a Software Tester.

I am currently doing a 90 days Switching to Software Testing course with Testify which will last for 30 days.

I hope to become a Tester before the end of the course so I will start testing Applications on my own.
